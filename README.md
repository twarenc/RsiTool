# RsiTool
Filter cryptocurrency pairs based on their RSI value


- REQUIRES .NET Framework 4.7

# How to use
- Set the RSI Period (default 14)
- Choose the candlestick period (default one hour)
- Choose the "RSI below" value filter (eg. show all coins with RSI Below x)
- Choose the "RSI above" value filter (eg. show all coins with RSI Above x)
- Click "Filter RSI"

The app should scan all Bittrex markets and display the coins and their RSI value in the right list boxes
It will take a while until it's finished (the buttons will be reenabled once process finishes)
Double-clicking on a currency pair in the listbox will open a browser window to the corresponding Bittrex market

Please note that the following candle intervals take (a lot) longer to calculate, as they are not directly provided by Bittrex:
	- 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 2 hour, 4 hour, 1 week, 1 month
